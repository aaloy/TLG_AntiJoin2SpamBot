* To get working the Anti-Spam, you must add me to a group and give me Administration privileges to let me read messages and delete Spam.

* Once I got Admin privileges, I'll watch for all new users that join the group and don't let them to publish messages that contains URLs until they have been in
the group long as an specific time, and they have written an enough number of messages.

* The time that new users need to wait and the number of messages that they need to write before they can publish messages with URLs are, by default, {allow_urls} hours and {min_msg} messages, but this values can be modified and configured by using the commands /set_messages and /set_hours.

* Also, I detect users with long names and/or the ones that has URLs in their names, when they join the chat, then I warning and delete the Telegram join message
of that user.

* To preserve a clean group, I auto-remove messages related to me, after {autodestruct} minutes (except Spam detection messages and Admins calls).

* Configuration and enable/disable commands just can be used by the group Administrators.

* You can change the language that I speak, using the command /language.

* Check /commands for get a list of all avaliable commands, and a short description of all of them.

* NOTE: I don't ban users, just detect, remove and notify Spam messages. This is the developer philosophy, the Bot notifies about Spam, but a human is the one who
must decide whether to ban the user or not.,
